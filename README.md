# Chess Board Game
## Problem Statement
You are required to create a program, which simulates an empty chessboard and the movements of three types of
chess pieces on it.
Chessboard: The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it. With 8 rows (1, 2, 3.... 8) and 8 columns (A, B, C.... H),
each cell can be uniquely identified with its cell number. This has been illustrated below:

A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1

Chess pieces:
The game of chess has 6 unique types of pieces - King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Horse and Pawn - each with their own
unique types of movements.

## What needs to be done:
You have to simulate the movement of the following three pieces on an empty chessboard:
1. Pawn - It can only move 1 step at a time, in the vertical forward direction.
2. King - It can only move 1 step at a time, in all 8 directions (vertical, horizontal and diagonal)
3. Queen - It can move across the board in all 8 directions.

## Inputs and Outputs to your program:
- Input - The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and itâ€™s position (cell number) on the
chessboard. E.g. Pawn, G1
- Output - Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all possible cells in which the chess piece can
move from its current position. For the above input, the output would be G2.

## Run Command
Run ChessMain.main() method

## Input/Output
- Enter the input in format (chess-piece, position) : king, d5
- Valid Position(s) : D6,D4,C5,E5,C6,E6,C4,E4
